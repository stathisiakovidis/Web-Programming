      <p>Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer programming.
        It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment.
        Eclipse is written mostly in Java and its primary use is for developing Java applications, but it may also be
        used to
        develop applications in other programming languages via plug-ins,
        including Ada, ABAP, C, C++, C#, Clojure, COBOL, D, Erlang, Fortran, Groovy, Haskell, JavaScript, Julia,
        Lasso, Lua, NATURAL, Perl, PHP, Prolog, Python, R, Ruby (including Ruby on Rails framework), Rust, Scala, and
        Scheme.
        It can also be used to develop documents with LaTeX (via a TeXlipse plug-in) and packages for the software
        Mathematica.
        Development environments include the Eclipse Java development tools (JDT) for Java and Scala, Eclipse CDT for
        C/C++,
        and Eclipse PDT for PHP, among others.
      </p>

      <p>The initial codebase originated from IBM VisualAge. The Eclipse software development kit (SDK), which includes
        the Java
        development tools, is meant for Java developers. Users can extend its abilities by installing plug-ins written
        for the Eclipse Platform, such as development toolkits for other programming languages, and can write and
        contribute
        their own plug-in modules. Since the introduction of the OSGi implementation (Equinox) in version 3 of Eclipse,
        plug-ins
        can be plugged-stopped dynamically and are termed (OSGI) bundles.
      </p>



      <p>Eclipse software development kit (SDK) is free and open-source software, released under the terms of the
        Eclipse Public License, although it is incompatible with the GNU General Public License.
        It was one of the first IDEs to run under GNU Classpath and it runs without problems under IcedTea.
