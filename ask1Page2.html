      <p>NetBeans is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Java. NetBeans allows
        applications to be developed from a set of modular software components called modules.
        NetBeans runs on Windows, macOS, Linux and Solaris. In addition to Java development,
        it has extensions for other languages like PHP, C, C++, HTML5, and JavaScript.
        Applications based on NetBeans, including the NetBeans IDE, can be extended by third party developers.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>NetBeans IDE is an open-source integrated development environment.</li>
          <li>NetBeans IDE supports development of all Java application types (Java SE (including JavaFX), 
            Java ME, web, EJB and mobile applications) out of the box.</li>
          <li>Among other features are:
            <ul>
              <li>An Ant-based project system</li>
              <li>Maven support</li>
              <li>Refactorings</li>
              <li>Version control (supporting CVS, Subversion, Git, Mercurial and Clearcase)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>Modularity: All the functions of the IDE are provided by modules. Each module provides a well-defined function,
        such as support for the Java language, editing, or support for the CVS versioning system, and SVN. NetBeans
        contains
        all the modules needed for Java development in a single download, allowing the user to start working
        immediately.
        Modules also allow NetBeans to be extended. New features, such as support for other programming languages,
        can be added by installing additional modules. For instance, Sun Studio, Sun Java Studio Enterprise, and Sun
        Java Studio Creator from Sun Microsystems are all based on the NetBeans IDE.
      </p>

      <p>License: The IDE is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. Previously, from July 2006 through 2007, NetBeans
        IDE
        was licensed under Sun's Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL), a license based on the Mozilla
        Public License (MPL).
        In October 2007, Sun announced that NetBeans would henceforth be offered under a dual license of the CDDL and
        the GPL version 2 licenses,
        h the GPL linking exception for GNU Classpath.[16] Oracle has donated NetBeans Platform and IDE to the Apache
        Foundation
        where it underwent incubation and graduated as a top level project in April 2019.
